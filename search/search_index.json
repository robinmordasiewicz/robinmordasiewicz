Through enabling efficient tracking, control, and management of changes made to code, SCM serves as the foundation of DevOps, ensuring smooth, accurate, and reliable software delivery processes. The growing complexity of software development projects requires such a system that oversees and facilitates collaboration, code versioning, and workflow management.</p> <p>GitHub is the most widely utilized SCM system today due to its extensive features, user-friendly interface, and the backing of a large and active community. Nonetheless, there are several other SCM platforms out there garnering considerable attention. Here are the top four:</p> <ul> <li>:octocat: GitHub</li> <li>:gitlab: GitLab</li> <li>:bitbucket-square: Bitbucket</li> <li>:align-left: AWS CodeCommit</li> </ul> <p>Mentioning SCM within DevOps context, it's hard to forget Git - the software that underpins GitHub, GitLab, and many other platforms. Git is in the essence of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, providing the necessary mechanism for maintaining, updating, and deploying the codebase. The integral role Git plays within DevOps practices means an understanding of its operations is crucial for any DevOps professional.</p>"},{"location":"img/screenshots/","title":"Screenshots folder","text":"<p>Save screenshots in this folder.
